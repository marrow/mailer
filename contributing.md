## Asking Questions

The first step in determining how best to tackle a concern is to ask about it. There are a number of avenues available for discussion and support.

* **Freenode IRC**

  Likely the best way to get fast turnaround on inquiries is through the Marrow Open Source Collective community on Freenode IRC.  Point your IRC client at the `#webcore` channel on `chat.freenode.net:6667` (SSL; non-SSL port 6667) or, if you are viewing this on a medium which supports it and have an IRC client installed which recognizes `irc://` URLs, just [use this link](irc://chat.freenode.net:6667/%23webcore).

  If you have general Python questions, [`##python-friendly`](irc://chat.freenode.net:6667/%23%23python-friendly), [`#python`](irc://chat.freenode.net:6667/%23python) may be more active. Stack Overflow is also worth considering.

* **Stack Overflow**

  To help develop a comprehensive knowledgebase of problems and solutions, with good metadata, user incentives, and fancy native apps, you can utilize Stack Overflow to ask your questions.  Just remember to tag your question [`marrow.mailer`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/marrow.mailer) so that it can be found.

* **GitHub Issues**

  For problems relating to bugs or enhancements witin Marrow Mailer itself, please utilize the [Marrow Mailer Issue Tracker](https://github.com/marrow/mailer/issues) provided by GitHub.  If you have identified an issue and have already begun work on a feature branch, just issue a pull request instead of creating a ticket, then creating a pull request.

  Please do not use the issue tracker for general support questions.  IRC or Stack Overflow are better resources for quick questions or longer questions, respectively.


## First Steps

* **Triage**

  If you find an [unreviewed ticket](https://github.com/marrow/mailer/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Alabel) reporting a bug, try to reproduce it. If the problem appears valid make a note that you confirmed the bug.

* **Help Wanted**

  Look through the [Help Wanted](https://github.com/marrow/mailer/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) issues on GitHub. Look for tickets with greater numbers of reactions and comments to help gauge impact. If you feel it's a problem you can help solve, ask to be assigned.

* **Write Some Documentation**

  We like to think that Marrow Mailer's documentation is excellent, but there's always room for improvement. Did you find a typo? Do you feel a certain section is unclear? Let us know by leaving a comment on the web version of this document—hover over a paragraph, use the speech bubble on the right—or feel free to contribute to the [book](https://github.com/marrow/mailer/tree/book).


## Guidelines

* **Start small.**

  It'll be less overwhelming to tackle a small, focused problem, and easier to get feedback.

* **Leave feedback.**

  See an idea being discussed, or a work-in-progress you feel could use your input? Do not hesitate to comment anywhere at any time.

* **Large (especially breaking) changes should be discussed.**

  [Create issues](https://github.com/marrow/mailer/issues/new) for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.

* **Be excellent to each-other.**

  Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

* **Code quality is a key priority.**

  We love code. To ensure our code is understandable and maintainable long into the future it is important that changes:

  1. Ensure cross-runtime (CPython, Pypy) and cross-version (2.7, 3.x) compatibility.
  2. Ensure code coverage and code health do not decrease.
  3. Ensure changes are up to date with their parent branch and that they do not conflict.


## Donations and Patreon Support

Financial contributions are welcome. To arrange a one-time donation, please contact `GothAlice` on IRC (see details above) and for more ongoing support we have [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/GothAlice) prepared for you. We have rewards (such as inclusion in the [Patrons team on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/marrow/teams/patrons) and our eternal gratitude) and goals, so please give it a look; every cent helps pay for infrastructure costs and caffeine. So much caffine.

If at any point you wish or need to cease recurring donations, do not feel bad. Don't put yourself out on our account, and thank you!
